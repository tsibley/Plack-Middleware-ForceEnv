NAME
    Plack::Middleware::ForceEnv - Force set environment variables for
    testing

SYNOPSIS
        # in app.psgi
        use Plack::Builder;

        builder {
            enable 'ForceEnv' =>
                REMOTE_ADDR => "127.0.0.1",
                REMOTE_USER => "trs";
            $app;
        };

        # with plackup
        plackup -e 'enable ForceEnv => REMOTE_USER => "trs"' app.psgi

DESCRIPTION
    ForceEnv modifies the environment passed to the application by adding
    your specified key value pairs.

    This is primarily useful when testing apps under plackup (or similar) in
    a development environment.
